Matthew Morgan made two appearances for Wales at the 2015 World Cup

Matthew Morgan says he turned down offers from around the world to join
Cardiff Blues in the pursuit of adding to his five Wales caps.

The 23-year-old back will leave Bristol at the end of the season in May.

"I had a number of offers from England, France and Japan, but moving back to
Wales was the correct decision at this point in my career," said Morgan.

"I feel I can test myself and develop the skills I need to keep knocking on
the door for Wales."

Newport Gwent Dragons were [also keen ](/sport/rugby-union/35173004)to sign
Morgan, who can play at full-back or fly-half, and started against Fiji in
last year's World Cup.

He is in his second season at Bristol and has scored 167 points in 28
appearances for the Championship side [he joined](/sport/rugby-union/26448128)
from Ospreys in May 2014.

Morgan was named Championship player of the season in his debut campaign in
England.

Blues head coach Danny Wilson worked with the player at Bristol and with Wales
under-20s and expects Morgan to play most of the time at full-back.

"He has the ability to cover other positions but it's primarily full-back that
we have recruited him for," said Wilson.

"It dovetails in with what Wales have done with Matthew recently. Matthew on
our (artificial) surface (at the Arms Park) will be a real threat with his
footwork and his ability to beat defenders."

Morgan played 66 games for the Ospreys but found his game-time at fly-half
limited by Dan Biggar and the emerging Sam Davies, prompting his move to
Bristol.
