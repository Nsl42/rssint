Scott Mitchell is the defending champion at Lakeside, having beaten Martin
Adams in last year's final

Defending champion Scott Mitchell survived a scare against Mark McGeeney to
reach the quarter-finals of the BDO World Championships at Lakeside.

McGeeney, 43, missed eight darts to defeat the sixth seed before Mitchell won
a sudden-death leg against his England team-mate and pairs partner.

Mitchell, 45, threw for the match three times but was pegged back by 11th seed
McGeeney on each occasion.

Both missed chances to win the deciding leg before Mitchell landed double top.

Mitchell told BBC Sport: "I knew that game was never going to be easy.

"Mark McGeeney's a name people probably won't know but I've stood behind him
when he's been doing that for England at the World Cup. You can't break him,
you can't break his spirit.

"Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

"I really don't want to give this thing up. Averages don't interest me, being
in the next round is what interests me.

"I've had tough games and I've played tough with them. I've got away with this
one, but I'm still in."
