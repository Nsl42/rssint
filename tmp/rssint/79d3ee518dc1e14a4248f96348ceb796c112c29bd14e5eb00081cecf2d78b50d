Matthew Morgan made his senior Wales debut against South Africa in June 2014

Matthew Morgan can force his way into Wales' team for the Six Nations,
according to Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson.

Morgan, 23, will [join the Blues](/sport/rugby-union/35248374) from Bristol at
the end of the season.

His rivals for the Wales full-back berth, Leigh Halfpenny, Liam Williams and
Gareth Anscombe, are injured.

"We need people fighting for places, giving headaches to selectors, and
Matthew is definitely in that mix," Wilson told BBC Wales Sport.

Wilson worked with Morgan, who can play at fly-half and full-back, at Bristol
and with Wales Under-20s.

Morgan played 66 games for the Ospreys but left for Bristol in May 2014 with
his game-time at fly-half limited by Dan Biggar and the emerging Sam Davies.

He has scored 167 points in 28 appearances in two seasons with Bristol and was
named Championship player of the season in his debut campaign in England.

Swansea-born Morgan started at full-back against Fiji in last year's World
Cup, one of two appearances for Wales in the tournament.
