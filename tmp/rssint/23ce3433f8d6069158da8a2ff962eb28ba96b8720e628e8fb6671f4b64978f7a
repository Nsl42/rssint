Iffy's journey back into to football

If you ever needed inspiration to participate in sport then look no further
than Iffy.

After immigrating to London from Nigeria and giving birth, Iffy knew hardly
anyone in the Croydon area. She felt depressed and lonely but decided to do
something about it.

After signing up for the FA People's Cup as an individual she found a team
that inspired her to take up football more regularly and she couldn't be
happier.

She feels like she's "made sisters for life."
