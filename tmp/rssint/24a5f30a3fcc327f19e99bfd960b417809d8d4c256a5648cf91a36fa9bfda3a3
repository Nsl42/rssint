Wollf believes for female drivers to succeed in motorsport, more young girls
need to start karting from an early age

Susie Wolff is launching an initiative aimed at increasing the number of women
involved in motorsport.

The Scot, who retired from racing last year, is joining forces with UK
motorsport authority the [MSA__](https://www.msauk.org/) for the scheme.

The former Williams test driver said: "I knew I wanted to give something back
when I stopped racing."

The scheme will start with motorsport, but there are plans to expand it into
other male-dominated environments.

Wolf said: "I never set out to become a role model but somehow I did.

"The opportunities are out there. We aim to inspire female talent to ensure in
the long term our sport is diverse."

It will be officially launched at the [Autosport International
Show__](http://www.autosportinternational.com/) at Birmingham's NEC on
Thursday 14 January.

Wolff spent three years involved in test and development work at Williams, and
took part in four practice sessions at grands prix over the 2014 and 2015
seasons.

Before that, she spent seven years driving for Mercedes in the German touring
car championship (DTM).
