Ben Stokes's double hundred came off 163 balls - the second fastest in Test
history

England all-rounder Ben Stokes could play another innings like his record-
breaking 258 against South Africa, says coach Trevor Bayliss.

The Durham man's innings in the [drawn second Test](/sport/cricket/35240872)
in Cape Town took 198 balls, making it the fastest 250 in Test history, and
contained 11 sixes.

"I probably won't play like this ever again," Stokes [said
afterwards.](/sport/cricket/35218318)

But Bayliss said: "I'm not sure it was a one-off. It's quite possible he could
do it again, he's that type of player."

Stokes' feat came seven months after the 24-year-old scored the [fastest Test
hundred at Lord's, ](/sport/cricket/32869388)off just 85 balls against New
Zealand.

"He's in the prime of his career and we all look forward to watching more of
that," Bayliss added.

The Australian defended Stokes after the all-rounder was seen to [aim foul
language](/sport/cricket/35235910) at South Africa batsman Temba Bavuma, who
made a century.

"He's a guy that plays the game with passion," said Bayliss. "As he gets
older, he'll tone it down a little bit and he'll realise that some comments
come back to bite you."

England lead their four-match series 1-0, having won the first Test in Durban.

### 'Catching let us down badly'

Missed chances 'frustrating' - England captain Cook

England dropped eight chances as South Africa amassed 627-7 declared in their
first innings, in reply to the tourists' 629-6 declared.

Bayliss acknowledged those missed opportunities cost his side the chance to
push for victory.

"If all the catches had been taken there would definitely have been a result,"
he said. "Our catching let us down badly.

"We could have been bowling for a win on the last day if we'd taken even half
of our catches. That's something we'll have to continue to work on."

### 'Bairstow will get better'

Bayliss praised wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, who made his maiden century in
England's first innings.

"Jonny scored a lot of runs for Yorkshire last year and he's done quite well
over the last few Test matches for us as well," he said.

"He could very easily play in this team just as a batsman and I think he'll
just get better from now."
