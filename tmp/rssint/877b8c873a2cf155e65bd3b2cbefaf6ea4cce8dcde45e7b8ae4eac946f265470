Roy Hodgson on how to sign up for the 2016 FA People's Cup

Have you ever dreamed of playing in the FA Cup?

BBC Get Inspired has again teamed up with the Football Association and the
country's leading small-pitch football providers to launch the 2016 FA
People's Cup, a free knockout competition that will give the people of England
the chance to play in their version of the FA Cup.

From Sunday League regulars to folk who have only kicked a ball in their back
yard, the tournament offers everyone the opportunity to follow in the path of
legends on the road to Cup glory.

### Who is it for?

The FA People's Cup welcomes male, female and disability players across 10
categories - ranging from under-14s through to veterans (over-35s). It also
features the increasingly popular walking football, which caters to those who
enjoy playing the beautiful game at a slightly more sedate pace.

It is open to established five-a-side teams as well as individuals, who will
have the opportunity to form teams at special 'squad-building' events before
the tournament. So if you have been looking for an excuse to get back into
football, this is for you.

The BBC will be following the competition every step of the way - and entrants
should not be surprised if they spot a few celebrity teams lining up in
opposition. BBC cameras will be visiting different venues throughout to
capture the action.

### How does it work?

The competition will take place over three rounds. The first round will be on
the weekend of 22-24 January. Teams that progress beyond round one will
qualify for regional semi-finals on 27-28 February with the grand finals to
follow in mid-March.

Disability players who want to take part can do so by emailing
[info@thefapeoplescup.com__](mailto:info@thefapeoplescup.com) with their name,
location, details of disability and contact details to receive more
information on local venues.
