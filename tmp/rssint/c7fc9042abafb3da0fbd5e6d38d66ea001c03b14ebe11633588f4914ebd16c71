Tom Allin played one first-class and one List A match for Warwickshire

Former Warwickshire fast bowler Tom Allin has died at the age of 28.

Allin, who played one first-class match and one List A game for the county
before leaving in 2013, also represented Devon and Cardiff MCCU.

Police said Allin was found at the base of a bridge near Bideford on Monday.
They are investigating the circumstances of his death but are not treating it
as suspicious.

Warwickshire described Allin as "incredibly popular".

He spent six years at the club, who added in a statement: "Everyone at
Edgbaston is immensely saddened."

Following the police investigation a file will be passed to the north Devon
coroner.

Allin is the second cricketer to die in a matter of days, following the [death
of Sussex bowler Matthew Hobden](/sport/cricket/35242789) at the age of 22.

Mark Ansell, chairman of Allin's league cricket club North Devon CC, said:
"Everyone at the club is devastated by the news of Tom's death.

"He was a great guy and this has come as such a shock. The players at the club
are numbed by what has happened. They met up on Tuesday night to support each
other."

Jason Ratcliffe, assistant chief executive of the Professional Cricketers'
Association (PCA), described Allin as a valued member of the organisation,
adding: "Our condolences go to Tom's family, particularly his father Tony who
is also a PCA member from his own playing career with Glamorgan in 1976."
