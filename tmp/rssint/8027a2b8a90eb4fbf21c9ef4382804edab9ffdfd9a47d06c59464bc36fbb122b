Kevin Ackerman's ban begins immediately and will run until 11 June

Towcester racecourse chief executive Kevin Ackerman has failed in his bid to
overturn a six-month suspension from racing.

Ackerman was initially [banned in October](/sport/horse-racing/34510026) last
year after being found guilty of corruption.

He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win.

Ackerman was granted a stay of implementation in November, but his
disqualification has been reactivated with immediate effect until 11 June.

However, his fine of £5,000 was quashed upon appeal, at the invitation of the
British Horseracing Authority.

Ackerman was banned after an investigation into six races featuring Ad Vitam
at Kempton and Wolverhampton between 2 November, 2011 and 8 March, 2012.

He was found to have breached the rules of racing alongside jockey Michael
Stainton, registered owner Kenneth Mackay and former owner David Greenwood.

Stainton was banned for two years, Mackay for six months and fined £5,000,
with Greenwood, who had already been warned off for a separate offence, banned
for eight years. All three also failed in their appeals, although, a separate
appeal by Stainton against the penalty imposed "will be considered in due
course".

Stewart-Moore Solicitors, who represent Ackerman, Greenwood and Mackay, said
in a statement that the "matter needs to be resolved by a High Court judge".

"Messrs Ackerman, Greenwood and Mackay have not acted in breach of the rules
of racing in any way," they added.

"In spite of this they have been found, yet again, to have taken part in a
conspiracy that has never been properly put to them."
